# 🔍 Setup Checker - Verify Your Installation

The setup checker (`check-setup.sh`) verifies your Mac development environment and shows you exactly what's working and what needs attention.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# After running the main setup
./check-setup.sh
```

## 📊 What It Shows

### ✅ Installed Tools
- Lists all installed development tools
- Shows version information where available
- Confirms tools are working properly

### ❌ Missing or Issues
- Identifies tools that failed to install
- Highlights configuration issues
- Suggests fixes for common problems

### 📈 Completion Percentage
- Overall setup completion rate
- Breakdown by category (frontend, mobile, devops, etc.)
- Progress tracking for partial installations

## 🎯 Example Output

```bash

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### Node.js Not Found
```bash
# Restart terminal or reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify Volta installation
volta --version
```

### VS Code Extensions Missing
```bash
# Manually install extensions
code --install-extension bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
code --install-extension esbenp.prettier-vscode
```

### PowerLevel10k Not Working
```bash
# Reconfigure PowerLevel10k
p10k configure

# Check theme installation
ls ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k
```

### Homebrew Issues
```bash
# Update Homebrew
brew update

# Check for issues
brew doctor
```

## 📈 Using Results for Troubleshooting

### High Completion Rate (90%+)
- ✅ Setup was successful
- Focus on configuring installed tools
- Run individual scripts for missing items

### Medium Completion Rate (70-89%)
- 🔧 Some components failed to install
- Check internet connection during setup
- Re-run specific category scripts

### Low Completion Rate (<70%)
- ❌ Major installation issues
- Check system requirements (macOS version, disk space)
- Consider running setup again with `--skip-prompts`

## ⚡ Advanced Usage

### Check Specific Categories
```bash
# Check just frontend tools
./scripts/05-frontend.sh --check-only

# Check just development apps  
./scripts/06-dev-apps.sh --check-only
```

### Export Results
```bash
# Save results to file
./check-setup.sh > setup-results.txt

# Check in CI/automated environments
SKIP_INTERACTIVE=true ./check-setup.sh
```

### Integration with Setup
```bash
# Run checker after setup
./setup.sh && ./check-setup.sh

# Check before re-running setup
./check-setup.sh && ./setup.sh --skip-prompts
```

## 🎯 Frontend Developer Focus

The checker prioritizes frontend development tools and shows specific metrics for:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem completeness**
- **React/Vue/Angular framework readiness** 
- **Mobile development (React Native) status**
- **Modern build tool availability**
- **Developer experience tool coverage**

This helps frontend developers quickly see if their environment is ready for:
- Building React/Vue applications
- Developing React Native mobile apps
- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Full-stack development with Node.js
